		  <h1>CSS</h1>
		  <p>While HTML code tells your website what code to display and where to display it, CSS tells your website how it should look. It is pretty much the styling language of the internet, as it allows you to change the appearance of almost everything on your website.

			Although CSS has a reputation of being somewhat difficult to learn and use, this isn’t necessarily deserved. If you use a decent course and take it slow, CSS isn’t that hard at all. If you want to become a front end web developer you will need to learn it anyway, no matter how hard it is.
			
			Just some of the things that CSS can help you do include:
			
			Changing fonts. If you work with a website building platform like WordPress you will be quite limited with what fonts you can use. However, learning CSS will let you choose not only your font but which parts of your webpage it should apply to!
			Changing colors. CSS also lets you change the color of pretty much everything on your website. Choose your background color, the color of your text, and even things like the color of your picture borders!
			Changing the size of the elements. Once you master CSS you will be able to create stylesheets that allow you to change the size of different elements on your page. Customize the size of things like your text, your headings, and even your embedded pictures and videos.</p>
