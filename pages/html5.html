		<h1>HTML5</h1>
		<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is pretty much the universal language of the internet. It is used by just about every website in existence to make their content visible and readily viewable. If you want to find an entry level front end developer job, you need to learn HTML. Before we go into a full explanation of what it is and how you can learn it, I need you to discover it for yourself.

			Right-click on your browser window and click on the ‘view page source’ option. A new tab containing lines of code should open in your browser – this is the source code that tells your browser how to display this page. At the top of the document, you will notice a line of code saying /‘/</DOCTYPE html/>/’. This command tells your browser to expect HTML code.
			
			Keep scrolling down the page and you might see other commands that you recognize like /‘/<link/>’ or /‘</video/>/’. I know that the code looks complicated, but don’t worry – it isn’t. Along with HTML, this page also contains snippets of JavaScript and CSS for interactivity and styling purposes, but more on them soon.
			
			Learning HTML will allow you to tell a webpage what content to display and how to display it. While major styling is done with CSS, HTML allows you to include things like images, videos, tables, and different sized text on your webpage, providing increased design flexibility.</p>
