		<h1>JavaScript</h1>
		<p>JavaScript is the third essential language that any prospective entry level front end developer absolutely must learn. It is used to create interactive elements that can’t be easily built with HTML or CSS. If you are serious about becoming a decent front end developer, then you need to master JavaScript.

			Since it is used for both front and back end development – among other things – JavaScript has quickly become one of the most popular programming languages on earth. The demand for JavaScript developers is huge, which means that having a decent knowledge of it should help you land entry-level web developer jobs. Some of the things that you can do with JavaScript include:
			
			Create interactive website elements. This includes things like push buttons, animations, and pretty much anything else which ‘looks good’ and reacts when you click on it or scroll over it.
			Create web apps. Ok, so this is probably more related to back end development than the front end, but JavaScript also lets you build web apps. This could come in handy as your career as a web developer progresses.
			Engage more people on your website. Once you have a working knowledge of JavaScript, you will be able to build an attractive, responsive website that draws people in and makes them more likely to react in the way you want them to.</p>
